# Day 1 — NumPy MLP from scratch

**Goal:** Implement a 2‑layer neural network (hidden layer + output) from scratch to classify 2D points.

### Tasks
1. Load `train.csv` and `val.csv`.
2. Implement forward pass: affine -> ReLU -> affine -> sigmoid.
3. Implement binary cross‑entropy loss.
4. Backprop gradients for all weights/biases.
5. Train with mini‑batches (SGD) for 200–500 epochs.
6. Plot decision boundary and learning curve.
7. Achieve **≥ 90%** validation accuracy.

> Hints are embedded as TODOs in `mlp_scratch.py`.
